    Spatial Point Pattern Analysis to analyse the spatial distribution of forest 
    fire hotspots in Sumatra, Indonesia between 2015 and 2019. Within this web application, 
    users can perform various types of Spatial Point Pattern Analyses such as 
    Exploratory Data Analysis, Kernel Density Estimation, Spatial Cluster Analysis, 
    and Spatiotemporal Area Analysis."),
  p("This application was created as part of Singapore Management Universityâ€™s IS415 
    Geospatial Analytics & Applications 2023, under the guidance of Professor Kam Tin 
    Seong. The project aims to create an interactive web application that allows users 
    to carry out spatial point patterns analysis easily on forest fire hotspot data 
    from Indonesia without needing to write a single line of code."),
  h3("Background & Motivation"),
  p("Since the 1970s, Singapore has experienced bouts of haze due to slash-and-burn 
    forest clearing in Indonesia. These on-and-off occurrences compelled our group to 
    investigate the spread of forest fire events in Indonesia."),
  p("We therefore created FINE, a web app that uses geospatial analytics to visualise, 
    manipulate and analyze spatial forest fire hotspot data. This interactive and 
    consolidated platform makes it easier for not only ourselves, but others with 
    little to no GIS knowledge to access and analyse this forest fire data."),
